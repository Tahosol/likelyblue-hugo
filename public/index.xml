Why?
</h2><p>Why would anyone harden Firefox on Android? The answer can be summarized in a few keywords: Privacy, Security, and Freedom.</p>
<p>First, let&rsquo;s talk about privacy. Mobile browsers, or specifically Android browsers, are really bad for privacy. They are almost all closed-source and have questionable data collection practices. There are a few exceptions like <a href="https://github.com/uazo/cromite">Cromite</a>, <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/org.mozilla.fennec_fdroid/">Fennec F-Droid</a>, <a href="https://gitlab.com/ironfox-oss/IronFox">Ironfox</a>, <a href="https://github.com/fork-maintainers/iceraven-browser">Iceraven</a>, <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>, etc. They are valid options, but there are still some issues with them in my opinion.</p>

      <title>AdGuard Home vs Pi-hole: Why did I choose AdGuard?</title>

My Story
</h1><p>Back when I started my home lab journey, I began with Pi-hole. Many mainstream YouTubers recommended it, like LTT (Linus Tech Tips) and SOG (SomeOrdinaryGamers). It was amazing as my second self-hosted project, after I set up Nextcloud. However, it broke after I updated the Ubuntu system it was running on.</p>
<p>After that first time, I started to learn more about Docker and web-native stuff.That is why I switched to using Pi-hole in Docker. I felt confident that it wouldn&rsquo;t randomly break because of an update again. Unfortunately, I was wrong. It broke again a few months after the second Pi-hole setup.</p>

<a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-audio-metadata"></a>
What Is Audio Metadata?
</h1><p>If you are familiar with metadata, you can skip this part, as it is essentially the same for audio files. Metadata is designed to add additional information to a file. For audio, this information can include the title, artist, album, track number, genre, cover art, and more. Having this metadata is useful because it aids in organizing your files effectively.</p>
<h1 id="why-do-you-need-it">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#why-do-you-need-it"></a>
Why Do You Need It?
</h1><p>As mentioned previously, having metadata greatly assists in organizing all your files. How does it work? Most modern local music players can read the data in your audio files and sort them by album, complete with album covers.</p>

Archlinux snapper setup
</h1><p><strong>Warning: If you break your system by blindly copying and pasting commands, it is not my fault.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is just my way of doing this. It works for me, but I can&rsquo;t guarantee it will work for you.</strong></p>
<p>This is a guide to set up Snapper on Arch Linux for Btrfs if you use the Archinstall suggested partition layout. I will walk you through the process of installing Snapper with that layout <strong>ONLY</strong>.</p>

      <title>Fcitx5 Archlinux Hyprland</title>

        <![CDATA[<h1>Fcitx5 Archlinux Hyprland</h1><p>Author: Tahoso(tahoso@likely.blue)</p>
        
          <p>I recently reinstalled my Arch Linux installation. This means that I will need to set up Fcitx5 on Hyprland again soon. To prepare for this, I&rsquo;ve decided to research and reinstall simultaneously. This blog post documents the results of my research.</p>
<h3 id="1-install-it">
<a class="header-anchor" href="#1-install-it"></a>
1: Install it
</h3><blockquote>
<p>Note: By itself, fcitx5 has only a basic framework that just gives English support. If you want to input other languages, such as Chinese or Japanese, you need an Input Method Engine (IME). See Input method#List of available input method editors for a list of available IMEs.</p>

      <title>My Experience With Antivirus on Linux</title>

        <![CDATA[<h1>My Experience With Antivirus on Linux</h1><p>Author: Tahoso(tahoso@likely.blue)</p>
        
          <p>So I installed Anti-Virus software on my Linux system, and the reason behind it is pretty simple: I was bored. Yea! In my opinion, there is no better reason than that. I wanted to have fun tinkering with something, and AV seemed like a good idea at the time. I don&rsquo;t think everyone on Linux needs to have AV, and in fact, I believe it&rsquo;s quite useless on Linux for now. If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about the subject(AV), you can visit <a href="https://easylinuxtipsproject.blogspot.com/p/security.html#ID1.1">this blog</a>. For me, this was just for testing and learning purposes.</p>
