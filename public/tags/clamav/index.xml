        <![CDATA[<h1>My Experience With Antivirus on Linux</h1><p>Author: Tahoso(notyet)</p>
        
          <p>So I installed Anti-Virus software on my Linux system, and the reason behind it is pretty simple: I was bored. Yea! In my opinion, there is no better reason than that. I wanted to have fun tinkering with something, and AV seemed like a good idea at the time. I don&rsquo;t think everyone on Linux needs to have AV, and in fact, I believe it&rsquo;s quite useless on Linux for now. If you&rsquo;re interested in learning more about the subject(AV), you can visit <a href="https://easylinuxtipsproject.blogspot.com/p/security.html#ID1.1">this blog</a>. For me, this was just for testing and learning purposes.</p>
