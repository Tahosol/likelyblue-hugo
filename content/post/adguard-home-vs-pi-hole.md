# My Story

Back when I started my home lab journey, I began with Pi-hole. Many mainstream YouTubers recommended it, like LTT (Linus Tech Tips) and SOG (SomeOrdinaryGamers). It was amazing as my second self-hosted project, after I set up Nextcloud. However, it broke after I updated the Ubuntu system it was running on.

After that first time, I started to learn more about Docker and web-native stuff.That is why I switched to using Pi-hole in Docker. I felt confident that it wouldn't randomly break because of an update again. Unfortunately, I was wrong. It broke again a few months after the second Pi-hole setup.

I think it has something to do with Pi-hole moving from v5 to v6. So, technically, it was my fault for not reading the documentation before
```docker pull```. My passion still ran out after the second time it broke, though. That is how I decided to switch to AdGuard Home.

# The Different

From my first impression, Adguard feels much more polished and sleek. It feels like a more "professional" design. Also, the built-in update feature in the web UI is quite nice. It is not to say that Pi-hole's design is unprofessional. It’s just that when compared with Adguard, the UI of Pi-hole screams: "I AM A HOBBY PROJECT." It isn’t necessarily a bad thing. In fact, it is a subjective opinion from me, so it is not really a critique but more of a comment.

The other element that jumps into my eye is DoH support. Pi-hole, by default, does not have DoH support for upstream DNS. You could argue that it is not needed because Pi-hole users will use Unbound in recursive mode anyway. However, DoH is important, so I personally think it should be included by default. Adguard also provides an easier way to control caching via its web UI. It also offers a lot more choices for blocklists, which is great for less tech-savvy users.

Overall, I think Adguard is more user-friendly and family-oriented, like the name "Adguard **Home**." Unfortunately, it does have some downsides that bug me a lot. The dashboard is poor. It does not have as extensive information compared to Pi-hole. It isn’t just me; there are a lot of other users who seem to think the same. So the takeaway from this blog is: ADGUARD TEAM, please upgrade your dashboard.
